cookbook
========
The cookbook application is a sample startup Ruby on Rails application for CSC 517 class. There are categories and recipes 
such that the categories contain many recipes. 
It is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed at http://radiant-oasis-2193.herokuapp.com/categories/


Since this is a sample app, the objective behind it is just to understand how to start with rails. 
The Backchannel app at https://github.com/pshegde/backchannelapp was the next project that I worked on and 
is a complete application.
